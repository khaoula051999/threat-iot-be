# the rule of game of life

## These rules, which compare the behaviour of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:

1/Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2/Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3/All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
